# Sorting Algorithms Benchmark
This project is an example of how to use the Google Benchmark tool to test for algorithm's runtime and complexity. Created in the context of Polimi's Advanced Algorithms and Parallel Programming held by Prof. Fabrizio Ferrandi.

## Build
Install Google Benchmark following its README file, then use the suggested command to compile the sort.c.
 
The benchmarks will execute automatically and give results, also trying to compute complexity by fitting the correct curve.
